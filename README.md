This application is created using MVVM design pattern while utilizing the coordinators for navigation.

# Why?

regular MVVM and MVC patterns allow the View Controllers to be responsible for navigation which gives them wayy too much responsibility.
This is where coordinators come in. With Coordinators Viewcontroller A does not know about the existance of ViewController B the entire navigation is handled by the Coordinators.

This is a step towards to achieving the single responsibility principle in iOS
